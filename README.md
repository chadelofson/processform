#Process Form

This repo is to handle form submissions through Wix Velo sites that use embedded forms.  SalesForce does not have an API, so this web page is to be hosted on a free hosting service like Netlify to handle the call.

Currently, this is to see what type of information is sent back from submission.  Then communicate back to the Wix site to handle the callback.
